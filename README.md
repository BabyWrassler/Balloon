Balloon
=======

This is prototype code eventually intended for telemetry between a near-space balloon and a computer on earth, involving communication between an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi running lighttpd.

The jsondatadisplay.py and style.css files go in /var/www on the Pi, which is running lighttpd. 

The Arduino that I have running the BalloonAlamodeJSON sketch doesn't actually have an Alamode, just an XBee radio connected to it. Another XBee radio sits on the Pi. The radios are basically acting like wire, passing everything through.

The TablePic.png file is a screenshot of the HTML table generated by the jsondatadisplay.py and style.css files.
